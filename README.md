# 🌟 DAG Royale 🚀

Welcome to DAG Royale, a game built on the Constellation Network's DAG technology. This project was created as part of the Metagraph Hackathon to showcase the potential of decentralized applications in creating engaging and fair gaming experiences.

## 🎮 What is DAG Royale?

Players send DAG tokens to a designated address, competing for a chance to win big while contributing to an ever-growing prize pool.

### ✨ Key Features

- 🏆 Daily draws with automatic prize distribution
- 📊 Real-time leaderboard updates
- 🔍 Transparent transaction history
- 🎨 Space-themed UI with parallax effects
- 📱 Responsive design for desktop and mobile

## 🛠 Installation
For comprehensive installation instructions, please refer to our [Installation Guide](INSTALL.md).

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Connect your DAG wallet**: Ensure you have a DAG wallet set up on the Constellation Network.
2. **Make a deposit**: Send DAG tokens (minimum 5 DAG) to the displayed deposit address.
3. **Watch the leaderboard**: See your position update in real-time as other players join the fray.
4. **Cross your fingers**: Wait for the daily draw and hope for the big win!

## 🏆 Hackathon Submission Details

This project was proudly submitted to the Metagraph Hackathon https://metagraph.devpost.com/. Our team, poured our hearts (and countless cups of coffee) into creating an application that not only demonstrates the power of DAG technology but also provides an entertaining and fair gaming experience.

### 🌟 Why DAG Royale Stands Out

1. **Fair Play Mechanics**: Our prize distribution algorithm ensures that every participant has a chance to win, not just the top contributors.
2. **Stunning Visuals**: The space-themed UI isn't just pretty - it's a performant, responsive design that works across devices.
3. **Real-World Potential**: While created for a hackathon, DAG Royale has the bones of a production-ready application, showcasing real-world use cases for blockchain technology in gaming.
